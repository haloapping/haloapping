		<h1>About</h1>
		<section class="text-desc">
			<p>
				Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a love for
				creating engaging, user-friendly digital experiences. With a
				deep understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, I
				specialize in building responsive websites and applications
				that are not only visually appealing but also functionally
				robust.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with
				various programming languages and frameworks. My expertise
				includes JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and server-side development
				using frameworks like Express.js and Golang. I constantly
				strive to stay updated with the latest trends and
				technologies, as I believe the tech world is continuously
				evolving, and there's always something new to learn.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of my core principles as a developer is to prioritize
				user experience. Every project I undertake is driven by the
				desire to create solutions that are intuitive and
				accessible, ensuring that users have a seamless interaction
				with the product. I'm also a strong advocate for clean,
				maintainable code. I believe that a well-organized codebase
				is essential for long-term success, both for individual
				projects and for collaborative environments.
			</p>

			<p>
				Beyond coding, I love exploring new ways to optimize
				workflows and enhance productivity. Whether it's through
				automating tasks, experimenting with design patterns, or
				integrating tools like Git for version control, I’m always
				looking for opportunities to improve efficiency.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of work, I'm an avid learner and enjoy diving into
				topics that expand my knowledge and skill set. I’m excited
				to take on challenging projects that push my abilities and
				allow me to create meaningful digital experiences.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thank you for stopping by! If you'd like to discuss web
				development, potential collaborations, or simply say hello,
				feel free to reach out.
			</p>
